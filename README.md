### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ ![Visit counter](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=godaup&color=blue)


I have been researching on Machine Learning and Data Science for several years. I have done my M. Sc. in mathematics, specifically theoretic computer science and algorithmic complexity. Currently I pursue a Ph.D. in Medical Imaging at the German Cancer Reseach Center.

**Academic track:** I have [published](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VRcPeykAAAAJ) several journal articles and papers on national and international conferences such as MICCAI, BVM, CVPR and NeurIPS workshop. I have won multiple [awards](https://www.dkfz.de/en/imsy/awards/index.html) as a reviewer as well as participant of biomedical challenges and hackathons. I lead the subgroup of [Intelligent Systems for Surgery and Endoscopy (ISSE)](https://www.dkfz.de/en/imsy/team/index.html).

**Developer track:** I am the main developer of the [`mml` Python package](https://github.com/IMSY-DKFZ/mml), an open source library which aims to provide an easy and scalable way of deep learning on multiple image tasks. It incorporates multiple common machine learning tools, such as [pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch), [pytorch-lightning](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/pytorch-lightning), [hydra](https://github.com/facebookresearch/hydra), [timm](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-image-models), [segmentation-models-pytorch](https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models.pytorch), [albumentations](https://github.com/albumentations-team/albumentations), [kornia](https://github.com/kornia/kornia) and many more.
